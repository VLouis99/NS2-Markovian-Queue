For on off exponentialin

If mu_on is the param for on period. Then 1/mu_on is the the burst time and 1/mu_off is the idle time
on follows exp(mu_on)

Similar to poisson where 1/lambda is the time between packets and lambda is the average amount of packets per sec
lambda = average rate for poisson


average rate = (rate* burst time)  / (burst_time + idle time)

if we set burst time to 0, idle time to 1/lambda, and set rate very high, we have a poisson distribution


'''

FOR CBR

interval = 1/rate
average rate is rate_
